## My Project - To-Do's Collection

This repository showcases diverse implementations of To-Do applications in JavaScript and React, using various coding approaches.

Each To-Do variant is organized in a separate folder:

- [Version 1 - To-Do (JavaScript)](https://github.com/NelutuNemes/To-Do-s-Collection/blob/main/Version1/README.md)
- [Version 2 - To-Do (JavaScript)](https://github.com/NelutuNemes/To-Do-s-Collection/blob/main/Version2/README.md)
- [Version 3 - To-Do (React)](https://github.com/NelutuNemes/To-Do-s-Collection/blob/main/Version3/README.md)


#  How to Use
Open the index.html file from each To-Do version in a web browser, for Version 1 and Version 2 (JavaScript implementations), interact with the To-Do apps based on the specific features of each implementation.

For Version 3 (React implementation), follow these steps:

Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
Run 'npm install' to install dependencies.
Execute 'npm run dev' to launch the React app.
Interact with the To-Do app based on the specific features of the React implementation.

Explore and experiment with different approaches to managing tasks.

#  Notes
Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in the browser for the proper functioning of the To-Do Collection.
