This folder contains the implementation of the third version of a To-Do application written in React.

# Overview
The To-Do project in Version 3 provides a dynamic and interactive task management system using React. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.

# Files
App.jsx: The main React component defining the structure of the To-Do application.
Input.jsx: React component handling user input for adding tasks.
